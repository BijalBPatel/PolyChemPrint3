# PolyChemPrint3
Free and Open Source 3D Printer control software targeted at 
Research Users (Polymer/Paste/BioPrinting)
Written in/for Python 3.3+ (but may work on others)

This software was initially written by Bijal Patel from 2017-2021 as 
an object-oriented cross-platform tool and successor to 
PolyPrint, a Perl script.

Within our lab (Diao Group at the University of Illinois 
http://diao.scs.illinois.edu/Diao_Lab/Home.html) 
we have succesfully used it to print solutions for organic 
semiconductors/conductors, polymer photonics, hydrogels, chocolate, etc. 

The software is written to be convenient for researchers with 
features like automatic data logging, parameterized shapes, and 
convenient macros.
