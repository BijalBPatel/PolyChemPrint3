# PolyPrint
Free and Open Source 3D Printer control software (Perl) targeted at Research Users (Polymer/Paste/BioPrinting)

This software was initially written by Bijal Patel to be run on Debian 9 using the Lulzbot Taz 6 and Nordson EFD Ultimus V extruder. In principle it can be easily modified to accept any 3D Printer and extruder hardware that is capable of serial communication. 

Within our lab (Diao Group at the University of Illinois - http://diao.scs.illinois.edu/Diao_Lab/Home.html) we have succesfully used it to print solutions for organic semiconductors/conductors, polymer photonics, hydrogels, and even chocolate. The software is written to be convenient for researchers with features like automatic data logging, parameterized shapes, and convenient macros.
