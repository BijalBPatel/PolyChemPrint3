Description: # PolyChemPrint3
        Free and Open Source 3D Printer control software (Perl) targeted at 
        Research Users (Polymer/Paste/BioPrinting)
        Written in/for Python 3.3+
        
        This software was initially written by Bijal Patel from 2017-2019 as 
        an object-oriented cross-platform tool and successor to 
        PolyPrint, a Perl script.
        
        Within our lab (Diao Group at the University of Illinois 
        http://diao.scs.illinois.edu/Diao_Lab/Home.html) 
        we have succesfully used it to print solutions for organic 
        semiconductors/conductors, polymer photonics, hydrogels, chocolate, etc. 
        
        The software is written to be convenient for researchers with 
        features like automatic data logging, parameterized shapes, and 
        convenient macros.
