**P1** through **P5** inform users the basic information of this sequence. **P6** controls the speed of the axes movement and unit is in mm/min. **P7** through **P9** control the width, length, and height of the cuboid. The unit for those value is in mm. **P10** controls layer height. Since this is a 3D object, 2D layers needs to be build up to form 3D shapes. Layer height is the distance axes need to move in positive z direction when one layer is done printing.

**Tool ON**, **Tool OFF**, **PRIME**, **VIEW**, and **GO** commands have been described in user guide **6.1.1** and **6.1.2**. Please see them for more information
