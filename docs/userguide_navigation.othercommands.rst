T ? , / . Commands
==================

Type in **T** to perform a test code run. 

Type **?** to repeat the current menu, just like refresh. In this case, a new Main Menu will appear.

The **/** command works just like how it is depicted in the program: repeat last command. For example, if the previous command typed in the terminal is **T** to run test code, the **T** 

command will be stored in the **/** commands. Now, type **/** will be identified as typing what is saved in **/**, in this case, **T**.

The **.** command will repeat the command that is save in Stored Saved Command.

The **,** command lets users save a command, so user can just type **.** to perform a long command instead of typing the long command every time.
