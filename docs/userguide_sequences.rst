Working with Sequences
======================

In Sequence Menu, users can execute sequences, which are pre-programmed, parameterized print routines stored as python files and loaded to RAM when the program launches. These pre-defines commands allows axes move in steps that eventually create 2D and 3D shapes such as rectangles, cuboid and etc. Some sequence also can load locally stored G-code file into the program to let axes follow a much complex and irregular shape. Here is what the Sequence Menu looks like:
