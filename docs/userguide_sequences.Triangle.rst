=================

Triangle Sequence allows a triangle shape to be created. Here is what the menu looks like:

**P1** through **P5** inform users the basic information of the line sequence. **P6** controls moving speed of axes when printing. The unit is in mm/min. In order to create a unique triangle, three pieces of information are needed: two sides length and the angle they formed. **P7** through **P9** control those information. For side lengths, units are in mm. For angle, the unit is in degree. **P10**, **steps in x and y**, is necessary due to the axesâ€™ limited ability of only creating straight line. Since one side of triangle has to be diagonal line. To create it, axes needs to be move in small steps in x and y direction. The small the value is, the more accurate the triangle is going to be.

**Tool ON**, **Tool OFF**, **PRIME**, **VIEW**, and **GO** commands have been described in user guide **6.1.1** and **6.1.2**. Please see them for more information
