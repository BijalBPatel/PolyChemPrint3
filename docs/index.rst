Welcome to PolyChemPrint3's User Guide and Software Documentation!
==================================================================

PolyChemPrint3 is an open source benchtop additive manufacturing software. This readthedocs page contains two sections: a 'user guide' for instructions on setting up and operating the program, and a 'software guide' intended as a programming aid that contains the organized python docstrings for the modules, classes, and methods of this object-oriented program.
