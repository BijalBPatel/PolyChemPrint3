Program Overview
================

The polychemprint3 is a software that allow users to gain direct controllability over hardware (typical 3D printers and pressure dispensers) by sending movements and dispensing pressure commands. Combination of singular command allows hardware to move following specific 2D and 3D patterns such as rectangle, triangle, cube, and etc. Such series of commands are called “sequences”. Polychemprint3 also can convert G-code file into movement commands, thus allow hardware to create much complex shapes. Instead of generating on shape at a time, multiple 2D or 3D shapes can be creating all together through “recipe”, a multi-sequence list build by users themselves.
