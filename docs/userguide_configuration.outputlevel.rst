Change Level of Output Detail
=============================

By entering command **1** in **Configure/About Menu**, the amount of details presented in the program will be altered. Currently, only two levels of output details exit: “more” level and “less” level. Whether this alternation increases or reduce amount of information displayed depends on the current level of output details. If the program is in the “more” level, type in **1** will change to “less” level and vice versa.
