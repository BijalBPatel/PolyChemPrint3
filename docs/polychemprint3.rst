PCP3 Package Overview
=====================

PolyChemPrint3 is written as a (mostly) object-oriented program. The package is structured such that each "Type" of object is contained in its own folder/module in the root directory. Within each of these folders are the abstract base classes (if required) and classes that contain implementations for specific hardware/software/sequences/recipes etc.
