Quit the Program
================

Type in **q** to quit the program and users will be asking for a confirmation that whether they want to quit the program or to internally reset the program like the following:

Now, type **Y** or **q** will let users exist out of the program and returning to the terminal. (Note: polychemprint3 is not case sensitive)
Type **N** will reset the program, which means restarting the program and any work that is not saved will be lost.
