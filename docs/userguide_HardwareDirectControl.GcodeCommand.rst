Control Through Gcode
=====================

Direct GCODE command is accepted in Hardware Menu. For example, if axes need to be moved in positive x direction for 20 mm, Gcode command **“G0 X20”** can be typed in to perform such task. Visualization is shown below:

Instead of typing Gcode every time, build in command options are available for the convenience of users.
