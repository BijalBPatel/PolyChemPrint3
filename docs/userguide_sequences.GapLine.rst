**P1** through **P5** inform users the basic information of the gapLine sequence. **P6** controls printing speed which is how fast axes moves when materials are been printed. **P7** controls travel speed which is how fast axes move when no material is been deployed but the sequence is still running for example, during printing of the gap between lines. **P8** controls length of each line segment and **P9** represents the size of gap between line segments.  **P10**, number of rows, is how many rows of line are there to be print. **P11** controls spacing between each row, which is the distance axes moves in y direction when done printing one row. **P12**, z-hop, value is the distance to move axes in positive z direction when printing gap. 

**Tool ON**, **Tool OFF**, **PRIME**, **VIEW**, and **GO** commands have been described in user guide **6.1.1** and **6.1.2**. Please see them for more information
